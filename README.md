This file consist of all the coding for our project.

New Version
-Added Database function
-Create a database(JavaDB) first, then recreate table using the following file
(Complaint.grab, Students.grab,Status.grab)
-You might encounter error if try to run, that is because in the coding, I uses my usernname and password. 
 Thus for every managedbean, you need to change according to your JavaDB username and password
